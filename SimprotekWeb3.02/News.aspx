                        <b>Simprotek</b></span> is pleased to announce that starting July 22, 2013, 
                    the <em>World&#39;s Drying Guru, Professor Arun S. Mujumdar</em> formerly of <em>McGill 
                    University, Montreal, Canada</em> and currently just retired from the <em>National University of 
                    Singapore</em> becomes Senior Advisor to <strong>Simprosys</strong> and guides its development for 
                    both industrial and academic users on a global scale. Everyone knows <em>Dr. 
                    Mujumdar as Founding Chair </em>of the widely acclaimed <em>International Drying 
                    Symposium (IDS)</em> series since 1978, as Editor of the Bible of Drying: <em>The 
                    Handbook of Industrial Drying</em>&nbsp;and as Editor-in-Chief of <em>Drying Technology-An 
                    International Journal</em>. He has over 500 published papers, 3 authored books and 
                    some 70 edited book volumes. His knowledge and experience in drying area is 
                    simply unmatched by anyone in the world. He has contributed to archival drying 
                    literature as World&#39;s number one with over 250 referred papers on drying while 
                    the subsequent positions have contributed less than half of his number. His 
                    knowledge of drying and associated issues is peerless in almost all industrial 
                    sectors. We believe that <strong>Simprosys</strong> can advance at a faster clip and become globally 
                        recognized brand with the new expertise and experience we can bring to bear in 
                        our software development effort.</span></p>
